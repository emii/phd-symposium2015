            <p>Tom Gilbert is Professor of Palaeogenomics at the University of Copenhagen's Natural History Museum of Denmark, as well as an Adjunct Professor at Curtin University (Australia). After obtaining a BA in Biological Sciences in 2000, he remained at Oxford to undertake D.Phil research with Alan Cooper, in which his research focussed on the challenges of working with ancient genetic materials. In 2003 he moved to a postdoctoral position in Michael Worobeyâ€™s lab at the University of Arizona, to develop methods needed to recover RNA from archival Congolese human biopsy samples, work that lead them to refine our understanding of the origin and spread of the HIV-1 virus. Since 2005 he has been based at the University of Copenhagen, where his research group principally focusses on exploring the potential of both ancient biomolecules (in particular nucleic acids and protein) as well as modern genomic and metagenomic data.</p>
