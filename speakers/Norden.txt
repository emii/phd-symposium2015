            <h3>Max-Planck-Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics</h3>
            <p>Caren Norden is group leader at the Max-Planck-Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden since 2009. The overall goal of the research in her lab is to understand tissue formation on a cellular basis. In particular, they aim to understand how the retina forms evolving from the eyefield into a multilayered neuronal structure in zebrafish. Overall this research spans a broad range of developmental programs that lead to the formation of highly organized central nervous system structures. The findings obtained in the retina can in fact be extrapolated to other, less accessible parts of the brain.</p>
