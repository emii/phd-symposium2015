            <p>Ville develops computational methods to discover and understand functionally relevant genetic and phenotypic variation. He has a background in engineering and physics and he has been working in the field of quantitative biology for the last ten years. At the Sanger Institute his group is studying rapidly evolving populations, for example to better understand how they react to external challenges. The work is done with systems of direct relevance to human health, in the context of cancer, infectious disease and evolution of drug resistance.</p>
