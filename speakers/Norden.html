            <h3>Max-Planck-Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics</h3>
            <p>Caren Norden received her PhD in Biology from the Institute of Biochemistry, ETH-Zurich, Switzerland. After her post-doctoral work there, and at Cambridge University, UK, she moved to a group leader position at the Max-Planck-Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden in 2010. The goal of the research in her lab is to understand tissue formation on a cellular basis. In particular, they aim to understand how the retina forms from the eyefield into a multilayered neuronal structure in zebrafish. Furthermore they aim to elucidate how neurons once born reach their final position at which they polarize and fulfill their function. Overall this research spans a broad range of developmental programs that lead to the formation of highly organized CNS structures. </p>
