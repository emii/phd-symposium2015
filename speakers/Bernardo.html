            <p>Pau Bernadó is group leader at the Centre de Biochimie Structurale in Montpellier. The research interests of his group are focused in understanding the interplay between structure, dynamics and function in highly flexible proteins. These goals are achieved combining Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Small-Angle X-ray Scattering and computational tools. Using integrative approaches his group aims to characterize the structural preferences of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and understand their ability to perform highly specialized functions in the cells.</p>
