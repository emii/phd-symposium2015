            <h3>Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine</h3>
            <p>Martin Falcke is group leader at the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine in Berlin. His research is focused on mathematical cell physiology. His group aims to apply hierarchic stochastic modeling to the study of complex physiological processes. In particular, his group is interested in the mathematical analysis of systems characterized by noisy components, temporal randomness and cell-to-cell variability, as intracellular Ca2<sup>+</sup> signaling.</p>
